# Project developed by Guido Narduzzi and Pasquale Miglionico, undergraduate fellows at the Scuola Normale Superiore of Pisa and students of the Department of Biology at the University of Pisa, under the direction of Dr. Filippo Disanto, University of Pisa, Department of Mathematics
# This is RGTProb, the gene tree probability calculator. This tool will allow you to calculate Ranked Gene Tree probabilities conditioning on a species tree in multiple formats. You can modify the program as you like, but please always mention the original project. If you develop something interesting please let us know, so that we can work together to better our software and make it available to the public.
# We suggest that you read the short tutorial before using our software, it will provide you with useful information about the formats of the inputs and outputs of the program and on how to use it.
