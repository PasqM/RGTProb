# Welcome to RGTProb, the gene tree probability calculator. This tool will allow you to calculate Ranked Gene Tree probabilities conditioning on a species tree in multiple formats. You can modify the program as you like, but please always mention the original project. If you develop something interesting please let us know, so that we can work together to better our software and make it available to the public.
